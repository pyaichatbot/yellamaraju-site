Imagine this scenario: At 2 AM on a Tuesday, a team gets a call. Their AI-powered fraud detection system has flagged 40% of legitimate transactions as fraudulent. Customers are furious. The system has been in production for three months, and they've just discovered a fundamental flaw: they'd never properly validated whether AI was the right solution.

That night cost them €50K in lost revenue and three months of development time. The lesson? **Most AI projects fail not because the technology is wrong, but because the use case evaluation is wrong.**

[McKinsey's 2025 State of AI report](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai) ([detailed analysis](https://medium.com/@david.hung.yang/deep-dive-into-mckinseys-the-state-of-ai-in-2025-from-everyone-using-ai-to-a-few-using-it-6095987cec14)) finds that while 88% of organizations use AI in at least one business function, nearly two-thirds remain in experiment or pilot mode, with only about one-third having genuinely scaled AI across functions. Why? They skip the assessment phase. They jump to building before asking "Should we build this?"

This is the framework I wish we'd used back then. I apply it to every AI initiative now, before writing a single line of code.

<Callout type="warning" title="The Real Question">
This isn't about "How do we build an AI/ML model?" It's about "Does this problem actually NEED AI? And if yes, what LEVEL of AI?"
</Callout>

## The Three Failures That Kill AI Projects

Why do AI projects fail? After working on dozens of initiatives, I've noticed three patterns that keep showing up:

1. **Bad Problem Statement** - "We want to use AI for customer support" isn't a problem—it's a solution looking for a problem. What's the actual pain? Long response times? High ticket volume? Start with the business problem, not the technology.

2. **Wrong Abstraction Level** - Building a Level 4 (Advanced ML) system when Level 1 (Rules) would work. Over-engineering kills projects. A simple rule-based system catches 85% of cases, but teams jump to deep learning "because AI is cool." Match the AI level to the problem complexity.

3. **Wrong Expectations** - Expecting 100% accuracy from day one. AI systems are probabilistic. They improve over time. Teams abandon projects when initial accuracy is 75% instead of 95%. Set realistic success criteria based on baseline performance.

<Callout type="success" title="Real Example">
A fraud detection system started at 85% accuracy with simple Logistic Regression. After two years of iteration, it reached 99.2% with ensemble models. But they almost killed it in month three because "85% wasn't good enough." The lesson: start simple, improve iteratively.
</Callout>

## The 3-Dimensional Assessment Framework

Every AI use case must pass three dimensions: **Desirability**, **Feasibility**, and **Viability**. Fail any dimension, and the project should stop or pivot.

<Mermaid

`}
  id="3d-assessment-framework"
  title="3-Dimensional Assessment Framework"
/>

### Dimension 1: Desirability — Is the Problem Worth Solving?

**Question:** Would solving this problem create measurable business value?

**What to Assess:**

1. **Quantified Impact**
   - What's the current cost of the problem? (Time, money, errors)
   - What's the cost of doing nothing?
   - What's the measurable improvement we need?

2. **Strategic Alignment**
   - Does this align with business priorities?
   - Is there executive sponsorship?
   - Will users actually adopt this?

3. **Success Metrics**
   - How will we measure success?
   - What's the baseline performance today?
   - What improvement justifies the investment?

**Example: Fraud Detection**

```
Problem: Fraudulent transactions slip through our rule-based system
Current State: 2.8% fraud rate, costs €5M annually
Target State: Reduce to &lt;0.8% fraud rate (€3M savings)
Baseline: Manual rules catch 1.8% fraud
Success Metric: Fraud catch rate >99%, false positives &lt;0.5%
```

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Vague problem statement ("improve customer experience")
- ❌ No baseline metrics
- ❌ No clear business owner
- ❌ Success criteria are subjective

**Green Lights:**
- ✅ Quantified current cost
- ✅ Clear target improvement
- ✅ Measurable success metrics
- ✅ Business owner identified

### Dimension 2: Feasibility — Can We Technically Do This?

**Question:** Do we have the data, skills, and infrastructure to build this?

**What to Assess:**

1. **Data Reality Check**
   - Do we have the data we need? (Not "can we collect it"—do we HAVE it?)
   - Is the data labeled? Complete? Fresh?
   - How much historical data exists?
   - What's the data quality?

2. **Technical Fit**
   - Does this problem require AI, or would rules/heuristics work?
   - Do we have the technical skills in-house?
   - Can we integrate with existing systems?
   - Are there compliance/regulatory constraints?

3. **Data Access & Governance**
   - Can we legally use this data?
   - Do we have privacy/compliance approval?
   - Who owns the data, and will they give us access?

**Example: Customer Churn Prediction**

```
Data Needed: 6-12 months of customer behavior + churn labels
Data We Have: ✅ Yes, 6-12 months per customer
Labels: ✅ Yes, but...
Issue: Some regions have only 3 months of history
Issue: Definition of "churn" varies by product
Decision: DATA EXISTS, but quality needs validation (PoC risk)
```

**Example: Merchant Category Code Automation**

```
Data Needed: Merchant records with correct category codes
Data We Have: ✅ Yes, 200K merchant records
Issue: Historical data is 80% correct (20% wrong categories)
Issue: No machine-readable explanations of why merchants get certain codes
Decision: Can't train ML on 80% correct labels. STOP or pivot to rules + GenAI
```

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Data doesn't exist (only "we could collect it")
- ❌ Data quality &lt;70% (too many missing values, errors)
- ❌ No labeled training data
- ❌ Compliance blockers (GDPR, industry regulations)
- ❌ Data locked in vendor systems we don't control

**Green Lights:**
- ✅ Data exists and is accessible
- ✅ Data quality >85%
- ✅ Labeled training data available
- ✅ Compliance approval obtained
- ✅ Technical team has required skills

### Dimension 3: Viability — Can We Sustain This?

**Question:** Is this financially justified and operationally sustainable?

**What to Assess:**

1. **ROI Calculation**
   - Annual benefit: What will be saved/earned?
   - Implementation cost: What will it cost to build?
   - Operating cost: Ongoing maintenance/infrastructure
   - Payback period: When does it break even?

2. **Team & Skills**
   - Do we have the right team?
   - Can we maintain this long-term?
   - What training is needed?

3. **Change Management**
   - Will users adopt this?
   - What process changes are required?
   - Is the organization ready?

**Example: Fraud Detection ROI**

```
Year 1 (Implementation):
├─ Implementation cost: €600K
├─ Infrastructure cost: €200K
├─ Team cost (2 FTE): €250K
└─ Total Year 1 cost: €1,050K

Annual Benefit (Ongoing):
├─ Fraud reduction: €2M/year (0.8% rate instead of 2.8%)
├─ Manual review savings: €300K/year
└─ Total annual benefit: €2.3M/year

Payback Period: Year 1 = -€1,050K + €2.3M = +€1.25M
→ Positive in Year 1. ✅ GO

Risk Scenario (50% as good):
├─ Fraud reduction: €1M/year
├─ Manual review savings: €150K/year
├─ Total benefit: €1.15M/year
├─ Payback: 0.9 years
→ Still positive. ✅ GO
```

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Payback period >2 years
- ❌ ROI is negative even in best case
- ❌ No budget for ongoing operations
- ❌ Team doesn't have skills (and can't acquire them)
- ❌ Users are resistant to change

**Green Lights:**
- ✅ Positive ROI in Year 1
- ✅ Payback period &lt;18 months
- ✅ Budget approved for build and operations
- ✅ Team has or can acquire skills
- ✅ Users are engaged and supportive

## The 5 Levels of AI: From Analytics to Agentic AI

Not all AI is created equal. Understanding AI levels helps you pick the right solution for your problem and avoid over-engineering.

<Callout type="info" title="Default Recommendation">
Start at Level 2 or 3. Most problems don't need Level 4 or 5. You can always upgrade later if needed. Over-engineering is a leading cause of AI project failure—[McKinsey's research](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai) ([analysis](https://medium.com/@david.hung.yang/deep-dive-into-mckinseys-the-state-of-ai-in-2025-from-everyone-using-ai-to-a-few-using-it-6095987cec14)) shows that most organizations remain stuck in pilot mode, often because they've over-engineered solutions instead of starting simple.

## Real Examples: Two Use Cases

Here's how this framework played out in two real projects:

### Example 1: Real-Time Fraud Detection ✅

**Problem:** Payment processing network handles 100M+ daily transactions. Rule-based fraud detection had high false positive rates—legitimate transactions were being declined.

**Assessment:** ✅ Desirability (€5M annual cost → €3M savings target), ✅ Feasibility (15+ years of labeled data, ML expertise), ✅ Viability (€2M+/year savings, positive Year 1 ROI)

**AI Level:** Level 4 (Advanced ML) - Real-time ensemble model, sub-100ms latency

**Result:** 99.2% fraud catch rate, 40% reduction in false positives, €2M+/year savings

**Key Lesson:** This took two years to mature. They started with Logistic Regression at 85% accuracy, then evolved to ensemble models. Don't expect Level 4 perfection on day one—it doesn't work that way.

### Example 2: Customer Churn Prediction 🟡 PoC

**Problem:** Banking platform needs to identify at-risk customers before they switch banks.

**Assessment:** ✅ Desirability (early identification → retention offers), 🟡 Feasibility (data quality gaps between banks, varying definitions), 🟡 Viability (€50K PoC, €200K+ full build, Year 1.5 payback)

**AI Level:** Level 2-3 (Predictive Analytics) - Baseline 72% accuracy, target 82-85%

**Status:** PoC Week 3 of 4. Initial validation: 81% accuracy (beats 72% baseline). Data quality issues discovered. Decision gate: GO, PIVOT, or STOP.

**Key Lesson:** This is what a real PoC looks like. Four weeks. Clear success criteria. Decision gates. Spending €50K to answer a €5M question? That's smart. Data quality issues are real, and you want to find them in a PoC, not after six months of development.

## PoC Validation: When Uncertainty Exists

If you're uncertain about any dimension, run a 2-4 week PoC. **Define success criteria BEFORE starting:**

- Model accuracy ≥75% (or beats baseline by X points)
- Data quality acceptable for production
- Team can operationalize this
- ROI math holds (actual results match projections)
- Technical feasibility confirmed

**Decision Points:**
- All criteria met? → ✅ GO to full build
- Missed 1-2 criteria? → 🔄 PIVOT (change approach, simplify)
- Missed 3+ criteria? → 🛑 STOP (not viable right now)

**Structure:** Week 1 (data assessment) → Week 2 (baseline) → Week 3 (ML model) → Week 4 (decision gate)

**Cost:** €50K-100K for a 4-week PoC. **Value:** It answers "Is this solvable?" before you commit €200K-1M+ to a full build.

For the complete PoC framework, download the [PoC Validation Checklist](/templates/poc-validation-checklist).

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

1. **"The Data is Terrible"** - Data quality is 60% but building Level 4 hoping ML can fix it. **Fix:** STOP and clean data first, or PIVOT to rules + manual, or GO WITH CAUTION with Level 1-2 models tolerant of bad data.

2. **"Simpler Works, Just Not Perfectly"** - Rules solve 85% of the problem. **Fix:** Maybe 85% is good enough? Or run a PoC to see if AI gets to 92% and if it's worth 3x the cost.

3. **"ROI is Marginal"** - Benefit is €100K/year, cost is €200K + €50K/year. **Fix:** STOP (payback >2 years), or POC to test cheaper approach, or PIVOT to reduce costs.

4. **"We're Uncertain"** - Think it could work but not sure. **Fix:** Run a 2-4 week PoC. Don't STOP because uncertain, don't GO blindly. Use PoC to reduce uncertainty.

## The AI Architecture Gate

For enterprise organizations, implement an **AI Architecture Gate**—a mandatory review before any AI project gets budget approval. Five gates: Problem Validation → AI Necessity → AI Level Approval → Data & Compliance → Risk Assessment.

The goal? Only justified, feasible, and safe AI use cases get budget approval. Download the [AI Architecture Gate template](/templates/ai-architecture-gate) for the complete framework.

## Checklist: Are You Ready to Build?

Before moving forward, make sure you can answer all of these:

- [ ] Problem is REAL (quantified impact, clear owner)
- [ ] Simpler solutions INSUFFICIENT (tested 3-5 alternatives)
- [ ] Data EXISTS and is CLEAN (quality >85%, labeled, accessible)
- [ ] AI Level is CLEAR (start simple, can upgrade later)
- [ ] ROI is POSITIVE (payback &lt;18 months, risk-adjusted)
- [ ] Stakeholders AGREED (business owner, technical lead, finance)
- [ ] Budget is APPROVED (build + operations)
- [ ] Team is ASSIGNED (has or can acquire skills)

**If any box is unchecked:** Don't proceed. Fix it first.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with the problem, not the solution** - "We want AI" isn't a problem statement.

2. **Test simpler first** - Rules and heuristics solve most problems. Don't jump straight to AI. [Research shows](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai) ([detailed analysis](https://medium.com/@david.hung.yang/deep-dive-into-mckinseys-the-state-of-ai-in-2025-from-everyone-using-ai-to-a-few-using-it-6095987cec14)) that organizations starting with simpler solutions scale more successfully.

3. **Check data early** - It's the biggest blocker. "Can we collect it?" is different from "Do we have it?"

4. **Calculate real ROI** - Not theoretical savings. Include implementation, operations, and risk.

5. **Match AI level to problem** - Start simple (Level 2-3). Upgrade later if needed.

6. **Use PoCs for uncertainty** - €50K to answer a €5M question is smart.

7. **Embrace NO decisions** - They're success, not failure. You've saved months and money.

8. **The goal isn't to build** - The goal is to answer: "Does this problem actually need AI?"

## What's Next

You've evaluated your use case. What happens now depends on your decision:

- **If GO:** Grab the [AI Use Case Assessment Worksheet](/templates/ai-use-case-assessment-worksheet) and start planning implementation
- **If POC:** Use the [PoC Validation Checklist](/templates/poc-validation-checklist) to structure your 4-week validation
- **If STOP:** Document why in the assessment worksheet. Revisit in six months—conditions change
